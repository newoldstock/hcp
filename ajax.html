        <h1>Welcome to the Habitat Agency Geobrowser</h1><br>

		<p>The Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan, administered by the Habitat Agency, provides a framework for promoting the protection and recovery of natural
			 resources, including endangered species,
			 while streamlining the permitting process for planned development, infrastructure, and maintenance activities. The Habitat Plan evaluates
			 natural-resource impacts and mitigation requirements comprehensively in a way that is more efficient and effective for at-risk species and their
			 essential habitats.</p><br>
		<p>The Habitat Agency Geobrowser was developed with the goal of providing a simple way of exploring and understanding the 
			spatial data important to the development of the Habitat Plan.  Click on the Show Help button to learn about the tools the geobrowser offers.</p><br>
